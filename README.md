# Welcome to my VS Code settings

This is the repo of my Visual Studio Code settings and keybindings.

## Prerequesite:

I use Dank Mono as the font family for my VS Code. This must be installed on your computer.

Make sure to install the extensions first before using your VS Code with my settings.

## Extensions

I generate and install extensions via command line. Check out my other [repo](https://github.com/earvinpiamonte/generate-code-extensions) on how to install the extension (for Linux/ MacOS users only).

## Clone and Usage

For Linux/ MacOS users:

```
cd ~/.config/Code/
git clone https://github.com/earvinpiamonte/generate-code-extensions.git
mv User/ User-old/
mv Code-User/ User/
```
